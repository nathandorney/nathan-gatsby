I read a lot online. So much infact I attrubute the marjorty of my career to knowledge I have found for free on the intrent. Over the years I have collected lot's of notes, some scribbled on bits of paper, but for the most part scattered around my head. 

As I started thinking about skills for a 40 year career, I realised the ability to share these thoughts and rambles would be great. However, I've always struggled to write. In school I was diagnosed with Dyslexia. When I first wrote anything it was from the right hand side of the page and half the letter's were backwards. 

These days I have managed to get conserdibbly better, and although I have a tendency to get my 'I's and 'E's the wrong way round I can share my thoughts using tools like Google's text to speech and Heming way editor. 

So whilst I started [learning to code](/notes/learning-to-code) I set up this blog as to encrouage myself to share more of my thoughts (and leearn to build a blog).
