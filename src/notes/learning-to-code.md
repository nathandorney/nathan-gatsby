I first thought about learning to code in 2015, I was working in a small team at an e-commerce commerce company. I wanted to be able to make custom emails and edit some pages on the Magento site. 

Fast forward 5 years and I feel like I am just about starting to make some progress. To be clear, I havent not been intensely trying for 5 years straight. I have given up more times than I care to admit. It is harder than I thought, but also easier, once I got the hang of things. So, if you are a design minded person and would like to give coding a go, I thought I’d share my experience in the hope it might save a headache or two.

> This is by no means a tutorial. I'm only just starting to get a grip with HTML/CSS & React myself. But here are the things I'd wish I'd known.

## 1. Learn how you learn

I have tried hundreds of courses & books over the years, some paid. But none of them really worked. I could start to get the grasp of html & css, however building some random 2001 looking website, or someone else’s design just didn’t work for me. I *learn by doing*.

## 2. Start simple
Simple idea, Get a  basic dev enviroment setup start making things.

## 3. Break it down
Into small peices, learn how to do that one little thing, then another then another.

## 4. Pick and stick
If in doubt **JFDI**
