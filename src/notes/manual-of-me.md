This is a user manual for working with me. I decided to create this guide mostly as an exercise of self reflection, but also as an opportunity to share a little more about what makes me tick with colleagues. This post was inspired by <a href="https://tomhiskey.co.uk/user-manual/" target="_blank">Tom Hiskey</a>, <a href="https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to" target="_blank">Julie Zhuo</a> and <a href="https://manualofme.co/" target="_blank">Manual of Me</a>.

## How I view success
* I'm striving to make a tangible difference to people's lives. So I view success as making someones day better.

* A succsesful project will both be amazing for the people using it and buisness. 

## How I communicate
* I'm a planner, I like to think through what I am going to say ahead of time. This ensures I cover everything I need to as my mind has a tendency to wonder down rabbit holes. 

* I do like impromptu conversations, unless I'm in deep work. You'll be able to tell I'm in focus-mode because I'll be wearing noise canceling headphones. In this case, drop me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I have completed my tasks. Unless the building in on fire, then please feel free to shake me vigorously.

* I like to have a agenda to stick to for meetings. And ideally agree on clear action points. During meeting I like ask a lot of changelling questions.  

* For me, email is not the one. There are no GIFs and Emoji's feel out of place. So Slack is where it's at for virtual communication. That being said nothing beats an in person chat over a brew. 

## Things I do that may annoy you
* I'm a big picture thinker. I always like to think outside of the box. This can be frustrating when someone requires a quick or small answer to a question.

## My strengths
* As a generalist, curiosity and empathy are my superpowers. Hard skills come and go. I work best surrounded by specialist. Asking good questions. 

## My growth areas
* Listening 
* Making (with code)
* Sharing (through writing)
